    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective Date: <strong>January 8, 2026</strong> | Version: 1.0.4</p>

    <p>Welcome to IPTV ID ("Application"). User privacy is important to us. This document explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use this Application.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>GDPR Compliance:</strong> This application fully complies with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you are located in the European Union or EEA, we will request your consent before collecting data for personalized advertising.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We strive to minimize data collection. The types of data that may be collected include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data you provide directly</strong>: such as playlists or M3U URLs you add to the Application, playlist names you save, and favorites (channels you mark as favorites). All these items are stored locally on your device unless you choose a synchronization feature (if available in the future).</li>
      <li><strong>Technical and usage data</strong>: non-personal information such as device type, OS version, app usage statistics (e.g., features used), and crash information that helps us fix bugs. This information is collected using analytics and crash reporting services mentioned below.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising data</strong>: information that enables serving relevant ads (e.g., device Advertising ID). The Application displays ads through third-party ad networks. <strong>For users in the European Union/EEA, we use Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request your consent before collecting advertising data.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Publisher-Provided ID</strong>: We generate a unique ID (UUID) that does not contain any personal information to meet Google AdMob GDPR requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section">2. Purpose of Data Use</h2>
    <p>We use data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and provide Application functions (playing channels, saving playlists/favorites locally, etc.).</li>
      <li>To improve service quality, diagnose and fix technical issues (through crash reporting and analytics).</li>
      <li>To serve relevant ads when the Application displays advertisements.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations or lawful requests from authorities when required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section">3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Playlist data, preferences, and favorites are stored locally on your device using local storage (we do not automatically upload them to our servers). Technical and crash data may be sent to third-party services (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Analytics) as described in the Third Parties section below.</p>
